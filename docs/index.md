# Welcome to SpaCEX!

## Introduction

The limited research on spatial gene co-expression within tissues hinders leveraging spatial genomic context for versatile gene representations. We introduce **SpaCEX**, a groundbreaking few-shot, self-supervised learning model.

As shown in the figure above , **SpaCEX** generates semantically meaningful gene embeddings (SGEs) by identifying spatial gene co-expression patterns. Cofunctional and enrichment analyses of SGEs endorse their utility as genomic contexts, validated through relational semantics and exploration of gene functional ontology. Three novel SGE-based methods are proposed for enhancing FISH-based spatial transcriptomics, detecting spatially variable genes, and spatial clustering. Extensive real data results affirm the superior performance of these methods, highlighting the utility of SGEs for downstream tasks.
